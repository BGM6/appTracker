# About

This web application was created for a few reasons. One of the main reason was to help myself stay organized with
the job applications I was sending out. Another reason was to implement all that I have been learning and use it
to solve a real world problem I was having. With this application the user is given a way to keep organize by keeping track
of job application the user enters. AppTracker utilizes React in the Front-end, Node.JS, Express and MongoDB as it's Back-end and uses
JSON web token for authentication. The application is deployed through Heroku.
