# About

This website was created for Jose and Jobelle's upcoming wedding celebration. 
I had designed the website with a mobile first approach in anticipation that a 
majority of the users will view the site with their mobile devices. The website primarily utilizes 
React and Bootstrap and is deployed through Heroku.
